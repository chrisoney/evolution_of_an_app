An unexpected accident during the study of his latest subject of intrigue, however, displaces him across the Planes beyond what any known spell is capable of achieving.\nNow finding himself lost in a realm rich in previously-limited Transcendental Essences, however, does he truly even want to return back to his old world? If nothing else, plagiarising - ahem, learning new spell structures by observing the local mages should prove entertaining. Sure, there were new dangers in this foreign world, but they wouldn't be anything a fancy bit of spellwork couldn't solve.\nThough, he would appreciate it greatly if someone could explain to him just what this 'cultivation' business was, why the local Mages were all muscle-brained freaks obsessed with immortality, and why they all seemed to lack any appreciation for the finer details of Essence manipulation. That would be nice.\n",

You may know me as the Tutor, who taught the Lion of Summer how to fight, or the Traveler, who has walked all the roads of the earth. I am all of these things.\nAnd people have branded me a myth.\nBut people don't understand what a myth is. They haven't heard the songs lost to our tongues, nor have they seen the things I've seen. They haven't gone to the places I've gone.\nMy feet have walked the plains, the seas, and the clouds. I have spoken languages unspoken; tongues lost to time. I have sung to the earth, held the moon in my arms, and walked the roads that your heroes hesitate to even mention. I have outwitted Demons. I have danced with the Fae. My songs have been heard by lords of wind and ash, and my steps have echoed in the bellies of gargantuan beasts the likes of which you have never seen.\nThese are what real myths are.

You'll see a few similarities here between this story and some existing stories, at least initially. There's a lot of inspiration drawn from both MoL and Re:Zero, though in terms of pathos and darkness, this story leans more towards the latter. Be warned, it is something of a slow burn. The main character will grow and become powerful, but a theme of this story is that power comes slowly and often at great cost. \nUpdates Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\nCover commissioned from the fantabulous SatoriLotus on Deviant Art\n",

But what if that future was not yours?\nAfter a gruesome death, Carina was reborn in Lafeara as Lady Maura, the unwanted \"half-blood\" of an impoverished noble family. The previous Lady Maura was publicly executed as part of a conspiracy to conceal the murder of Queen Eleanora.\nWith Maura's memories to guide her, Carina prepares to follow her predecessor's path into the palace as part of the Selection to become Crown Princess Eleanora's lady-in-waiting. Her meticulous years of planning and preparation to ensure her survival, fulfill Maura's revenge, and avert the oncoming Calamity will require every ounce of courage, cunning, and intellect she can muster.\nBecause Carina has more than one secret which she can not reveal-her true identity among them-but even more treacherous is her frozen heart and the ice magic that comes with it.\nAfter all, they still burn witches in Lafeara.\n\n{Book 2: A Coven of Crows} \nThe problem with changing the past is that the future changes with it.\nAlthough Carina survived the Selection and earned a place in the palace beside the Crown Princess, her battle to change the future and protect Lady Hana, the future Queen's favored lady-in-waiting, is far from over.\nAs Carina becomes further entwined in the hidden witch covens of Lafeara, their history and magic unravel a dangerous secret long forgotten by most. It is not just Maura's memories that threaten to shift the balance of Carina's carefully laid plains but her own forgotten past as well.\nAnd the more mysteries Carina uncovers, the fewer allies she finds standing on her side. Everyone wants something, but the most dangerous players in this game of mortals and witches are the gods themselves, who have their own sordid plans for Carina's frozen heart.\n{Book 3: A Plague of Witches} \nComing Soon...\n",

Well, for Ilea it didn't come quite as expected as for some other protagonists, nor was there a king or god to welcome her.\nThe grand quest? Well, she might figure that out someday but for now, a new world with new food is prize enough. Her fists at the ready, she's prepared to punch and get punched, however long it takes and however many limbs she might have to regrow.\nA story I've started writing now quite a while ago. Transported to another world, somewhat standard fantasy setting with my beginner attempts to make it dark but funny. There are Litrpg elements here but I do hope it's not too heavy and annoying. The fights should be interesting and aren't just numbers vs numbers. Contrary to the title the protagonist will be quite an offensive fighter.\nIlea Spears is your average sarcastic kick-boxing fast food worker and soon to be student. She will be transported to another world rather conventionally and will be confronted with survival in the wild.\nGive it a shot and let me know what you think. My experience is incredibly lacking. If you find yourself hating it early on, do convey your anger in a detailed comment or review :) I want to get better but without any feedback it's simply quite difficult.\nQuick heads up: Around chapter 120 there are a bunch of longer PoV changes that I discontinued again shortly after. The Arc around chapters 150-200 is darker than the rest and the themes shift quite a bit. Just know that it goes back to what you've come to know after that section.\nThank you for reading.\nQuick update June 2019: Many complaints regarding the formatting, specifically spacing in conversations and of course the usage of the present tense in the first 36 chapters have been addressed. I'm of course learning by the day but compared to how it was before it should be an improvement at least.\nChapters usually around 3k words\nCover art by Kevin Catalan\n",

Magic, supernatural abilities and rumors exploded from nothing and a subscription to The Tower of Somnus became a status symbol.\nKatherine 'Kat' Debs doesn't have much, but it could be worse.  Born in an arcology, she was assigned a job in the megacorporation that raised her almost as soon as she could work.  Despite the stability of her corporate life, she wanted something more.  A chance to claw her way up the rigid social and financial ladder to make something of herself.\nA chance that wouldn't come naturally to someone as familiar with dark alleyways and the glint of steel as she was with office work and corporate niceties.Cover art by Faewild\nColoring/shading by KrazeKode\n- - - - - -Book One was  a National Novel Writing Month/Writeathon entry.

        "description": "The world is in ruins. \nExtreme sub-zero temperatures suffocate the surface, making even simple survival an ordeal. Frozen derelicts of bygone eras span across massive ice wastes. And the elite few hoard any technology rediscovered within.\nThe only escape from the deadly climate is beneath the surface. But it's another disaster underground. Monstrous machines lurk in the depths. Unhinged demigods war against them, dying over and over, treating it all like a game. The land itself shifts over time, more contraption than rock. And an ominous prophecy states that the key to everything waits at the last level - but nobody's ever reached that far. \nWhen an expedition into the far uncharted north goes terribly wrong,  Keith Winterscar and his father get trapped together in a desperate fight for survival. Stumbling upon an ancient power struggle of titanic scale; the two will need to set their differences aside while they struggle against sinister gods, deadly legends, and the grand secrets of the realm that lies below. \nAuthor's note: Updating Monday and Thursdays. This is a long planned out fic. If you're looking for a power fantasy where the MC gets everything right all the time, this ain't it. Fights get hairy, people get greedy. Bad descisions happen on incomplete information - and I don't write fake-failures where those mistakes don't matter. When the whammy moments come, they'll be earned. \n[Dungeon-lite and gamelit-lite, though both start being relevant much later.]\n",

The Sorcerous Kingdom has entered the world's stage to the clamour of death and devastation; the surrounding nations fearfully prepare even as they reel from its calamitous debut. Within the borders of the newly annexed realm, its Human subjects cower in their homes as the Undead openly walk the streets and stalk the lands. Yet, when a destitute noble finds herself under the auspices of an unlikely benefactor, events are set into motion that will resound over the world for ages to come.\n\nA kingdom builder based on the events and setting of Kugane Maruyama's Overlord. In a fantasy world where beings of matchless power are transmigrated from the arbitrary existence of a game, Valkyrie's Shadow chronicles the lives of the natives whose reality has been turned upside down by their advent. It is the tale of a nation created by the whims of a supreme sovereign, and his unstoppable servants who each have their own, often twisted, interpretations of their Master's Will. \n\nThere is no victory in strength; no miracles wrought from magic that will save them: only the inexorable advance of a new world order where those who secure a place of service within will find themselves turned against the world that they once knew.\n\n[Slow buildup. Methodical storytelling with a focus on well-rounded kingdom building and character development.]\n",

I'm somewhat desensitized to gore and violence. So while the story isn't full of gore for the sake of gore, it can get a little too descriptive.-The MC is a necromancer, so corpses and decay, and all the things that come with it, will be mentioned from time to time.-I'm a huge fan of Egyptian, Slavic, and Greek mythology, so expect quite a bit of that. That said, so much is altered, you'll be hard-pressed to guess how exactly it is being used.-Despite being 'immortal' the MC can die. In the event he does, the story doesn't end, simply time skips forward. Which in some cases is going to be worse than just dying.-I love plot twists, as much as I love red herrings and Chekhov guns.

Over the years, he sought remedies for his affliction but had no luck. \nThis year, an Arcanist visits the small town of Wethermane. Vance is curious and intends to visit this powerful stranger, hoping for either help or hope. What he receives is something else, something greater - opportunity. \nThis book will follow his tale from afflicted young man to budding Arcanist, his struggles along the way, and hopefully a little humour.\nBook cover art by: Ollie Wodge\n\n",

What is this, a fantasy novel?\nAdventures? Right this way!\nA Grand quest? Nah.\nFriends and loot? Heck yes!\nHumans are the top dog? Nope, dinosaur food.\nHealing and fighting? Well, everything is trying to eat her.\nJoin Elaine as she travels around Pallos, discovering all the wonders and mysteries of the world, trying to find a place where she belongs, hunting those elusive mangos, all while the ominous Dragoneye Moons watch her every move.\nHey! Beneath the Dragoneye Moons is my first writing effort, so please be kind, but don't hesitate to point out the flaws.\nThe story starts off slowly, more like a slice of life than action-adventure, but it gets there!\nI'm going to be posting M-W-F\nI do know how the story ends, and I promise if it ever gets dropped, or I stop doing this, I will post the ending. There will be no random \"this is the last chapter\" out of the blue.\nCover art by Lee Kent: https://www.artstation.com/leekent\n\nThis story is being published on Royal Road, Tapas, and Scribblehub.\n\n[participant in the Royal Road Writathon challenge]\n",

Is it any wonder that old dreams are forgotten?\nWelcome to The Law of Averages: In which a man is dragged solidly out of his comfort zone. Be careful what you wish for, you never know when it will come true.\nThis story follows Daniel Newman as he adjusts to a strange new world. One where superpowers are for sale, where heroics are frowned upon, and where life is constantly defying Daniel's expectations.
