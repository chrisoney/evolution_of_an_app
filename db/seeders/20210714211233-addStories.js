           description:"Zorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems. As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he does have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn't been made for his sake and dangers lurk everywhere... Repetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have to first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill.\n**********************************\nIf anyone is interested, I have a story-related worldbuilding site that can be found here.

If you find yourself hating it early on, do convey your anger in a detailed comment or review :) I want to get better but without any feedback it's simply quite difficult.\nQuick heads up: Around chapter 120 there are a bunch of longer PoV changes that I discontinued again shortly after. The Arc around chapters 150-200 is darker than the rest and the themes shift quite a bit. Just know that it goes back to what you've come to know after that section.\nThank you for reading.\nQuick update June 2019: Many complaints regarding the formatting, specifically spacing in conversations and of course the usage of the present tense in the first 36 chapters have been addressed. I'm of course learning by the day but compared to how it was before it should be an improvement at least.\nChapters usually around 3k words\nCover art by Kevin Catalan",

           description:"Cadence Lee thought she was a normal girl, perhaps a little well to do, but not exceptionally so.  She had her college classes, she had her job that her uncle gave her, and she had a nice boyfriend who was sweet if a little awkward.\nExcept, when a mugger accosts Cadence and her boyfriend attempts to wrestle a gun away from the criminal, Cadence ends up shot.  A normal girl, with the kind of wound Cadence had, would die.  Cadence managed to do that part.  But a normal girl wouldn't then open her eyes again and learn that death is not as permanant for her as it is for other people.  She can be reborn again, and again.  Each time stronger and with new abilities.\nThe catch?  Any world she is born into, she can never return to.  She has infinite lives, but only one life for each.\nSo begins The Many Lives of Cadence Lee.\n[participant in the Royal Road Writathon challenge]",

           description:"The universe was a vast, empty, dark, and uncaring place. Then life happened, and the universe was changed forever. Only a teeny-tiny bit, but definitely different. Then again, the universe changes a teeny-tiny bit every second of every day. For instance, if someone were to get off the couch and randomly drink a glass of milk? Bam! One less glass of milk in the universe. Changed forever. Well, excluding any time-travel shenanigans, but anyone who puts a big old hole in the time-space continuum just to un-drink a glass of milk should really reevaluate their priorities. Unless, of course, they were attempting to prevent some massive catastrophe vis-a-vis said glass of milk. Such a scenario is by no means impossible, as one should never underestimate the importance of calcium.\nAnother important tip for any life forms out there is to keep things in perspective. Some look at the vastness of creation in relation to themselves and go, 'Man, this sucks!' These people really need to narrow their focus. Sure, they will never affect anything happening on the other end of the galaxy, but so what? That's way the heck over there, where it doesn't matter. Therefore, in order to maintain a healthy mindset, it is important to narrow one's perspective to the things and people that affect them, and that they can affect in turn.\nBut what happens if one is an unfathomable cosmic being from beyond the veil of reality? What happens when such an existence is capable of influencing entire swathes of the universe just by its presence? A creature such as Magh'rathlak the Observer? That particular entity is only about average as far as reality-warping creatures from the dawn of time go, so its influence over the fabric of reality is rather limited. And it still struggles to keep things in perspective. That, among other things, is why it decided to narrow its worldview a bit by compressing the maddening vastness of its being into a single corporeal form. Magh'rathlak had never tried such a feat, but that wasn't about to stop it.\nAfter all, how hard could being human possibly be?",

But what if that future was not yours?\nAfter a gruesome death, Carina was reborn in Lafeara as Lady Maura, the unwanted \"half-blood\" of an impoverished noble family. The previous Lady Maura was publicly executed as part of a conspiracy to conceal the murder of Queen Eleanora.\nWith Maura's memories to guide her, Carina prepares to follow her predecessor's path into the palace as part of the Selection to become Crown Princess Eleanora's lady-in-waiting. Her meticulous years of planning and preparation to ensure her survival, fulfill Maura's revenge, and avert the oncoming Calamity will require every ounce of courage, cunning, and intellect she can muster.\nBecause Carina has more than one secret which she can not reveal-her true identity among them-but even more treacherous is her frozen heart and the ice magic that comes with it.\nAfter all, they still burn witches in Lafeara.\n\n{Book 2: A Coven of Crows} \nThe problem with changing the past is that the future changes with it.\nAlthough Carina survived the Selection and earned a place in the palace beside the Crown Princess, her battle to change the future and protect Lady Hana, the future Queen's favored lady-in-waiting, is far from over.\nAs Carina becomes further entwined in the hidden witch covens of Lafeara, their history and magic unravel a dangerous secret long forgotten by most. It is not just Maura's memories that threaten to shift the balance of Carina's carefully laid plains but her own forgotten past as well.\nAnd the more mysteries Carina uncovers, the fewer allies she finds standing on her side. Everyone wants something, but the most dangerous players in this game of mortals and witches are the gods themselves, who have their own sordid plans for Carina's frozen heart.\n{Book 3: A Plague of Witches} \nComing Soon...",

A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that \"it\" factor, you may just find yourself with a following.

Earth was blockaded and our collective encounter with our extrasolar neighbors rapidly faded from memory.\nAll they left behind was a hypercomm relay and a handful of subscriptions to a massively multiplayer game that participants played in their sleep.  The Consensus said that it would let us interact with our neighbors in a controlled setting.  That it would teach us to be better members of the galactic community.\nThe megacorporations that controlled Earth ignored the game until they learned that the powers earned from clearing dungeons were just as real when day broke.  Magic, supernatural abilities and rumors exploded from nothing and a subscription to The Tower of Somnus became a status symbol.\nKatherine 'Kat' Debs doesn't have much, but it could be worse.

Frozen derelicts of bygone eras span across massive ice wastes. And the elite few hoard any technology rediscovered within.\nThe only escape from the deadly climate is beneath the surface. But it's another disaster underground. Monstrous machines lurk in the depths. Unhinged demigods war against them, dying over and over, treating it all like a game. The land itself shifts over time, more contraption than rock. And an ominous prophecy states that the key to everything waits at the last level - but nobody's ever reached that far. \nWhen an expedition into the far uncharted north goes terribly wrong,  Keith Winterscar and his father get trapped together in a desperate fight for survival. Stumbling upon an ancient power struggle of titanic scale; the two will need to set their differences aside while they struggle against sinister gods, deadly legends, and the grand secrets of the realm that lies below. \n\nAuthor's note: Updating Monday and Thursdays. This is a long planned out fic. If you're looking for a power fantasy where the MC gets everything right all the time, this ain't it. Fights get hairy, people get greedy.

           description:"This Used to be About Dungeons is a comfy slice-of-life adventuring story that occasionally features dungeons. Updates Wednesdays and sometimes Saturdays.\nMostly it's about walking in the woods with a friend, looking for mushrooms to put in your soup, or haggling with the guy selling squash, or taking care of a neglected garden. It's putting some jam on shortbread biscuits. And yes, sometimes you go down into the dungeons with your friends, and you kill monsters there, or disarm traps, but when you come out, you realize you've found the perfect magic item to give to one of the local kids that helped you out when your cat was sick. Look, the dungeons are always going to be there, and sometimes you need to make a journey to one of the Spirit Gates, or make a pilgrimage with the local Cleric of Symmetry to a holy shrine. Your tour through the local dungeons can wait. You'll have rivalries with other groups, and find some dungeon eggs that need to be carefully incubated in case they turn out to be something valuable, and help a friend to build a fishing weir. There's a big world out there, a mostly tame place with lots of magic, and even more to do and see. Join me, won't you?The cover image is Morning Sunlight Effect, Eragny, by Camille Pissarro.",

People from a technologically advanced society are thrown into a world where they can't maintain their tech. They are forced to rely on medieval technology where they have to make do with the limited resources they have and what little of their old technology is still working. Their gene manipulation allows them to have something akin to superpowers, but that doesn't help much against the monsters of their new world.

I'm somewhat desensitized to gore and violence. So while the story isn't full of gore for the sake of gore, it can get a little too descriptive.-The MC is a necromancer, so corpses and decay, and all the things that come with it, will be mentioned from time to time.-I'm a huge fan of Egyptian, Slavic, and Greek mythology, so expect quite a bit of that. That said, so much is altered, you'll be hard-pressed to guess how exactly it is being used.-Despite being 'immortal' the MC can die. In the event he does, the story doesn't end, simply time skips forward. Which in some cases is going to be worse than just dying.-I love plot twists, as much as I love red herrings and Chekhov guns.

In their new Golden Age, humanity developed technology that they had only dreamed about. The following years saw hundreds more ships crash into the planet, spurring even greater technological leaps.\nAn unassuming spacecraft, one of the dozens that fell yearly, descended on Siberia in 2021. The world took no particular notice of it. However, this one contained something beyond the miraculous technology that had made humans so prosperous.\nThree years later, in a top-secret underground facility in eastern Colorado, the automated construction of an army of Paladin Mobile Infantry Suits was underway. With this new, state-of-the-art weaponry, the military would turn the tide against the alien incursion that was consuming the planet. Humanity fell before that could happen. Sam was an engineer responsible for overseeing the facility. Now alone, he lives in utter boredom and near insanity, his only company the base's pseudo AI and an army of empty Paladins. With the world gone to hell around him, and the things that caused it still living above, he decides that he is much better off staying exactly where he is. Unfortunately for him, that is no longer an option.\n\nThis is the first novel I've written. The first fifteen or so chapters are going to be a little slower. I want there to be time to get to know the characters before they start blowing stuff up. Also, though the MC will be strong relative to the world, he won't be OP, and won't win every fight. Not every fight will be physical either.\nCurrently, I'm aiming for something like 5 fairly short chapters a week, after the introduction part is done, but we'll see how that goes.

           description:"The world has ended, and those worthy of it have received the chance for a new life in a new reality.\nZach grew in power and thrived in the post-Framework world. He became a respected leader, a shining example of what it meant to be good. But as the world ended, he had only one thought: to punish the monster that had killed the world long before the Framework ended it. Yet not even with his incredible power was he able to stand against the World Ender. His arrival in the new realty, the Infinite Realm, gives him the chance to grow stronger, to find the monster again-and make it pay.\nRyun survived the chaos after the arrival of the Framework by pushing harder than anyone else. He grew in power until he became the most powerful being that had ever walked the planet; but he is hated by the world, called a monster by all others, the World Ender. As the world ends and he steps into a new one, where people stronger than him have lived for centuries, he finds himself lost and without purpose. The only thing that had mattered to him had been lost to him long ago. He truly was the monster that people considered him to be, and he now finds himself wondering if this new reality has a place for someone like him-but he had never been one for lying down and dying without a fight. One world fell to his power, and another might follow.\n\nCurrent schedule: Monday/Wednesday/Friday\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/ncC5Q7H\nA polished and edited versions of volume 1 and 2 is avaliable on Amazon.\nCurrent Volume: 4\nInfinite Realm is a story that will follow two main characters at the start, with a few more joining the cast a bit later. The story will be told in two different time periods: past and present up until volume 3. Past chapters take place in the past on Earth, and take form of flashbacks that follow the two as they struggle to survive and grow their powers in the world changed by the Framework. The main story is in the present.\nThis story is a mix of LitRPG and Xianxia, and it will have Classes as well as Cultivation systems. There are two main characters, and a few others that are introduced later.\nThe MC focus will change from volume to volume, with the first being focused on Ryun, and the second on Zach (we are currently in Volume 3). Other MC will still have chapters dedicated to them, but the focus will be on the main volume MC.",
